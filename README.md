A set of blank mockups for modern web production that let's designers preview their mockups directly in the browser. Yep, it's responsive. Perfect for handing over to your developers or presenting the design for your clients.

How to use
-------

Choose between Facebook App or Web. Open index.html in a decent browser (hint: not IE<8). Then locate the source of the Psd's. Start designing and when save, save over the files with the same name in the /img folder. There you go. Happy responsive designing and nice correct previewing.

Source files
-------
We use photoshop files. Basically you can use your favorite design app. Just use the same document size as the Psd's and you are good to go.
